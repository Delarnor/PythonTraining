Modules are python files that contain code like variables or functions

To use them, we IMPORT the modules.
Just like import NumPy


A package or LIBRARY are multiple modules grouped together.
Popular librarues: 
    TensorFlow
    pandas (ML)
    NumPy
    SciPy

A framework is when a set of code is not just used together but also in a specific way.
We let the external code set the basic structure and flow of the program. 
It defines how we should accomplish a task.

Frameworks example:
    Django
    Flask
