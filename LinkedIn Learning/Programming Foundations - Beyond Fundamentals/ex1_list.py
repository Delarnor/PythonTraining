# Collections allow the grouping of multiple items together and
# stores them with a single name, called a variable.

# Uses the code structure to indicate that multiple pieces of data are related
# Avoids creating potentially huge number of variables to track within our code
# Offers simplified syntax

# List (ARRAY in C) - simple collection that groups pieces of data together in certain order
# and assigns the collection a name.

cities = ["Tokyo","Kyoto","Osaka"]

# In python, a list can be composed wih various data types, you can combine strings, floats, etc.
testlistone = [10000,"Yen","Japan"]  # Example of a list with multiple data types.
# However in some other languages, like C++ all the items in a collection must be of the same type.


# How to access items in a list?

print(cities) # this line prints the whole list

print(cities[0]) # this line prints the position 0, the first from the list
