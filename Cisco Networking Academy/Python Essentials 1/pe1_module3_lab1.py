# Using one of the comparison operators in Python, 
# write a simple two-line program that takes the parameter n as input,
# which is an integer, and prints False if n is less than 100,
# and True if n is greater than or equal to 100.

# Don't create any if blocks (we're going to talk about them very soon). Test your code using the data we've provided for you.


# n = int(input("Give me a number: "))
# print("Your input is lower than 100:",n < 100)
# print("Your input is higher or equal to 100:",n >= 100)

# Solution:

n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(n >= 100)
