# Basic Operators

# Exponentiation
    # when both ** arguments are integers, the result is an integer, too;
    # when at least one ** argument is a float, the result is a float, too.

# or not the result seems to be a float at first glance: 1 / 2,
# or if it looks like a pure integer: 2 / 1.

                          # or is always equal to zero (for floats); 
                          # this means that the results are always rounded;
                          # it conforms to the integer vs. float rule.

# Operators and their bindings

# The binding of the operator determines the order of computations
# performed by some operators with equal priority, put side by side in one expression.

print(9 % 6 % 2) # left side binding, output = 1

# Repeat the experiment, but now with exponentiation.

print(2 ** 2 ** 3) # right side binding, output = 256
# the 2 ** 3 is calculated first (2x2x2=8) and then the 2 ** 8 is calculated (2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2 = 256)

# A unary operator is an operator with only one operand, e.g., -1, or +3.
# A binary operator is an operator with two operands, e.g., 4 + 5, or 12 % 5.
