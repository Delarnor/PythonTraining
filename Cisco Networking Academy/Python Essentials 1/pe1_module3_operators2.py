# Shortcut operators

# It's time for the next set of operators that make a developer's life easier. 
# Very often, we want to use one and the same variable both to the right and left sides of the = operator.

# For example, if we need to calculate a series of successive values of powers of 2, 
# we may use a piece like this:

x = 1
sheep = 1


x *= 2     # Same as: x = x * 2
sheep += 1 # Same as: sheep = sheep + 1
