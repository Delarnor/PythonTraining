# The backslash (\) has a very special meaning when used inside strings ‒ 
# this is called the escape character. The word escape should be understood specifically ‒ it means that the series of characters in the string escapes for the moment 
# (a very short moment) to introduce a special inclusion. The letter n placed after the backslash comes from the word newline.
